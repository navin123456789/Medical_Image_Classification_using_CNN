# Medical_Image_Classification_using_CNN
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify medical images and determine whether a bone is fractured or not. The goal is to develop an automated system to assist healthcare professionals by analyzing X-ray images and identifying bone fractures efficiently.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project consists of X-ray images that are labeled as either "fractured" or "not fractured." These images are preprocessed to normalize and resize them, ensuring that they are suitable for training the CNN model

**Methodology**
Preprocessing: Images are resized to a fixed dimension, and data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling are applied to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the model’s robustness.
CNN Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented with several layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers, to extract features and make predictions.
Training: The model is trained using a training set and evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate the model's effectiveness in classifying bone fractures.

**Model Architecture**
The model is built using a simple CNN with the following structure

Input Layer: Takes grayscale images of size SIZE x SIZE.
Convolutional Layers: Three layers (with 32, 64, and 128 filters) learn features like edges and patterns.
Max Pooling Layers: Reduce image size and keep the important features.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D features into a 1D vector.
Fully Connected Layers: The final layer predicts whether the bone is fractured or not fractured using a sigmoid activation.

**Results**
The model will output its accuracy and loss on the test dataset, along with predictions for each image, indicating whether a bone is fractured or not.


**Requirements**
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualizing results)
scikit-learn (for data processing)
gradio for interactive UI
